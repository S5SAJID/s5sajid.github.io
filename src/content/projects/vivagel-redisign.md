## 🎯 Objective

To redesign the VivaGel™ BV website with:

- A modern, mobile-first layout
- Professionally structured information architecture
- Emotionally-aware UX patterns for patients
- A visual system that aligns with the pharmaceutical industry

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

This redesign was built from the ground up using industry-appropriate principles:

- **Trust-first visuals**: Black & white design language with neobrutalist and clinical minimalism influence.
- **Content hierarchy**: Information flows from problem → cause → solution → science → action.
- **Tone & language**: Rewritten copy avoids fear-based messaging and uses calm, direct medical framing.
- **Design structure**: Inspired by medical dashboards, scientific journals, and global pharma UX standards.
