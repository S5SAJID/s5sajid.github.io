It started back around 2022. I was sitting around with my friends, talking about launching our own YouTube channels for tutorials. We knew we needed names that would stick—something unique that you wouldn't find anywhere else on YouTube or even Google. That’s when it hit me: **“S5SAJID.”** It was my name, Sajid, paired with the suffix “S5” to make it stand out from the noise.

Soon after, my brother RafiUllah joined the movement with the same prefix, calling his channel “S5Rafi.”

I worked on my channel for nearly a year and by the mercy of Allah that channel went too far, but then came a hard stop: YouTube banned my account. It was a setback, but it led to a new path. We traveled to Karachi for a tour, and while I was there, I downloaded an app called “Memo” to start learning HTML. Since I had experience with Blogger and site builders, I knew that if I wanted to build truly custom websites, I had to master the code HTML, CSS, and the rest InshaAllah.

At that time, my English wasn't great, so I turned to YouTube, hunting down free courses in Hindi and Urdu. I put my head down, learned the skills, and started building projects.

Once I had the skills, the urge to share came back. I re-entered the YouTube creator space, reclaiming my name, “S5SAJID,” but this time: Web Development.

By this time, my elder brother AbdUllah Shah launched his channel, “S5SHAHI.” This completed the circle and led to the official creation of our personal brand: **“S5Brand.”** From then on, any big project I launched became an extension of that identity—S5PAGES, S5ARC, and so on.

**Now, you might see many people—relatives or otherwise—using the "S5" suffix in their account names. Please remember: unless it’s us, those people do not represent our personal brand.**
